        <h1>How I Teach Game Development</h1>
    </header>

    

    <div class="blog-post-body">
        <p>When I teach game development, I’m not trying to turn students into programmers or artists overnight.
I’m helping them understand the process — how creativity, logic, and structure come together to make something playable, something real.</p>
<p>That’s the foundation of how I teach at Game City Kajaani and through Toucan Studios.
My goal isn’t just to show what buttons to press in Unreal Engine — it’s to show why those buttons matter.</p>
<p>🧩 Start Small, Think Big</p>
<p>Every student begins with an idea.
It’s usually big — an open-world RPG, a multiplayer shooter, a cinematic adventure.</p>
<p>So, our first step is learning to shrink the idea down without losing its soul.
We break it into a playable core: one mechanic, one space, one interaction.</p>
<p>Once that’s clear, I teach how to prototype fast using Unreal Engine’s Blueprint system.
You don’t need a perfect model or animation — you need something you can test.
That’s how students begin to see the game taking shape, even with cubes and placeholder art.</p>
<p>🐣 Student Projects and Mentorship</p>
<p>At Game City Kajaani, every student works on their own game — something they want to make.
It can be a small puzzle, a story-driven prototype, or a simple platformer.</p>
<p>My role isn’t to tell them what game to build — it’s to mentor them through the process.
I help them take their ideas, shape them into achievable goals, and build step by step until the game starts to come alive.</p>
<p>Each project becomes a personal learning journey.
Some focus on art, some on gameplay logic, others on worldbuilding — but everyone learns by making their own creative choices.</p>
<p>🧠 Process Over Perfection</p>
<p>In my classes, it’s okay to make mistakes — in fact, it’s required.</p>
<p>We work in short sprints, just like real studios do.
Each week, students pick one goal: a working door, a puzzle that resets, a simple combat system.
They test it, show it, and improve it.</p>
<p>I remind them constantly:</p>
<p>“Your game doesn’t fail when it looks rough. It fails when you stop improving it.”</p>
<p>By focusing on process, they learn how professionals think — iterating, testing, refining.</p>
<p>🎨 Art Meets Code</p>
<p>I’ve always believed that great games live where art and logic meet.</p>
<p>That’s why I encourage students to switch roles often.
An artist learns how a Blueprint node works.
A coder learns how to light a scene.</p>
<p>These aren’t separate disciplines — they’re different ways of expressing the same creative language.
When students understand that connection, they start to see how design, art, and programming all shape the player’s experience.</p>
<p>🧭 Real Studio Thinking</p>
<p>A big part of my teaching is helping students think like developers, not just learners.</p>
<p>We use task boards, version naming, and production planning — the same systems used in studios.
Even if it’s a two-person project, we track everything: assets, shots, builds, versions.</p>
<p>Because when students understand structure, creativity flows better.
You can’t build a world if you’re lost in your own folder tree.</p>
<p>💡 The “Why” Behind Every Lesson</p>
<p>Every exercise I teach has a reason.</p>
<p>If we build a maze, it’s to understand player guidance and reward loops.
If we script a light switch, it’s about interaction design.
If we build a modular level, it’s efficiency and iteration.</p>
<p>By the time students finish a course, they’re not just following tutorials —
they’re asking better questions, thinking critically, and creating intentionally.</p>
<p>🐦 Teaching at Game City Kajaani</p>
<p>Teaching at Game City Kajaani is special because it’s hands-on from day one.</p>
<p>My classroom is more like a small studio: students test, fail, fix, and show their work every week.
We celebrate working prototypes, not perfect renders.
The goal is confidence — the moment they realize, “I can build something that works.”</p>
<p>That moment never gets old.</p>
<p>✨ Why I Teach This Way</p>
<p>Because I’ve been on both sides.</p>
<p>I’ve been the beginner staring at a blank level, unsure where to start.
And I’ve been the artist in a production pipeline, solving problems under pressure.</p>
<p>Now I get to bridge those worlds — teaching others how to take an idea, structure it, and bring it to life.</p>
<p>That’s what teaching game development means to me:
helping students see that every great game starts with one clear idea — and the courage to build it.</p>
<p>🚀 Final Thoughts</p>
<p>If you’re a student, mentor, or aspiring developer reading this — start small, but start today.
The best way to learn is to build something, test it, and ask “why” after every success and failure.</p>
<p>That’s how I teach game development.
And it’s how I keep learning it, too.</p>
