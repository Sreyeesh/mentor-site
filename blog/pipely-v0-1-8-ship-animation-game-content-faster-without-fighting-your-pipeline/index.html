        <h1>Pipely v0.1.8 – Ship animation &amp; game content faster, without fighting your pipeline</h1>
    </header>

    

    <div class="blog-post-body">
        <p>If you’ve ever lost an afternoon to “Where did that file go?” or “Which version are we actually using?”, you’re not alone. Most small animation and game teams end up duct-taping folders, scripts, and naming conventions together and calling it a pipeline.</p>
<p>Pipely v0.1.8 exists so you don’t have to do that anymore.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Turning your pipeline into a friendly companion</h3>
<p>Pipely is a CLI-based pipeline companion built specifically for animators, technical artists, and small studios. It doesn’t assume you’re a DevOps engineer. It assumes you’re busy, under deadline, and just want things to <em>work</em>.</p>
<p>Instead of wrestling with ad-hoc tools and half-finished scripts, you get a guided, artist-first workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>A CLI and interactive mode that <em>speaks your language</em>—shows, shots, assets, not just paths and flags</li>
<li>Autocomplete that knows your projects and DCCs</li>
<li>Simple Git helpers so commits and status checks are quick, not painful</li>
</ul>
<p>You stay in flow; Pipely quietly handles the “pipeline” part in the background.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Real production tracking, without building a database yourself</h3>
<p>Most small teams either track everything in spreadsheets… or not at all.</p>
<p>Pipely v0.1.8 ships with production structure baked in:</p>
<ul>
<li>SQLite-backed database for <strong>shows, assets, shots, tasks, versions, and tags</strong></li>
<li>Built-in status flows like <strong>Ready, WIP, Blocked, Done</strong></li>
<li>Clear visibility into “what’s on my plate” and “what’s stuck”</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of rebuilding the same tracking system for every project, you get a simple, opinionated foundation that just works. You still keep your creative freedom—but with a backbone that’s actually production-ready.</p>
<hr />
<h3>One command to open the right file in the right app</h3>
<p>How many times a day do you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Blender</li>
<li>Search for the correct <code>.blend</code> file</li>
<li>Hope it’s the latest version</li>
<li>Realize someone else has another copy somewhere?</li>
</ul>
<p>Pipely replaces that dance with one command:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch <strong>Blender, Krita, Photoshop, After Effects, PureRef</strong>, and more directly from Pipely</li>
<li>Use project-aware defaults so it knows <em>which</em> file to open</li>
<li>Get friendly feedback when something’s off, instead of cryptic errors</li>
</ul>
<p>The result: less hunting, fewer mistakes, faster jumps from “I need to work on this shot” to actually working on it.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Built-in observability so tech issues don’t derail the team</h3>
<p>Even simple pipelines get messy as soon as a few people are using them. When something breaks, you need to know <em>where</em> and <em>why</em>.</p>
<p>Pipely v0.1.8 bakes in observability from day one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structured logging for consistent, readable logs</li>
<li>Request IDs so you can trace what actually happened</li>
<li>Optional StatsD metrics so tech leads can monitor behavior over time</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t have to bolt on debugging tools later. Pipely ships with them already wired in, so issues are faster to track down and fix.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Discipline that makes updates safe, not scary</h3>
<p>Updating pipeline tools mid-production can feel risky. One bad release and suddenly artists are blocked.</p>
<p>Pipely leans hard into release discipline:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conventional commits</strong> to keep history clean and understandable</li>
<li>An automatically generated <strong>changelog</strong> so you know exactly what changed</li>
<li>A <strong>Monday-only release guard</strong>, so teams get predictable updates at the start of the week—not surprises in the middle of a crunch</li>
</ul>
<p>You stay in control. You decide when to adopt new versions. And when you do, you know what you’re getting.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Designed for real-world teams and real-world machines</h3>
<p>Creative teams rarely run on identical hardware or OS setups. Pipely is built to handle that reality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Works on <strong>WSL, Windows, macOS, and Linux</strong></li>
<li>Smart path detection keeps projects aligned across different environments</li>
<li>Git/LFS-ready templates for animation, games, and illustration projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you’re a solo artist on a laptop or a small team spread over multiple machines, Pipely gives you a consistent way of working.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Keep the tech weight off your shoulders</h3>
<p>At its core, Pipely is about one thing: freeing creatives to focus on the work that actually ships.</p>
<ul>
<li>Artists stay in flow instead of playing “pipeline engineer”</li>
<li>Leads get clarity on progress and blockers</li>
<li>Small studios get big-studio structure without paying for a full-time pipeline department</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need to become a DevOps expert. You just need a tool that respects your time and your craft.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Ready to modernize your pipeline?</h3>
<p>You can explore Pipely, see examples, and get a feel for how it fits into your workflow:</p>
