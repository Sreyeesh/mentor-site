## Why a Blog?

I've spent years coaching artists and designers one-on-one. Writing things down
lets me share the most common questions and the practical answers I rely on
when guiding a mentee toward the next milestone.

## What to Expect

- Deep dives on animation workflow improvements.
- Career strategy checklists.
- Case studies from real mentorship sessions (anonymized).

If you have a question you'd like me to cover, reach out via the contact form
on the main site.

_See you in the next post!_
