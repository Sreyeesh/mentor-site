description: A practical breakdown of my mentoring approach to game development.

I teach game development by anchoring each session in a real production outcome.
We start with the student's current build, identify the next shippable milestone,
and set a plan that fits their tools, experience level, and timeline.

From there, I focus on three pillars:

1. Clear goals for each session and week.
2. Production-ready workflows that match studio standards.
3. Fast feedback loops so skills stick.

If you are building a portfolio game, we'll target the exact skills you need for
the role you want and the studios you are aiming for.
