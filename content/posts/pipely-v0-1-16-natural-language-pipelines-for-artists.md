title: Pipely v0.1.16 — Natural-Language Pipelines for Artists
---

What’s New in v0.1.16
Artist-first commands, written like real language

Pipely now understands plain, natural phrases. You can literally type:

open project 1 with blender

add environment asset called Forest_BG for show DMO

mark task Paint for DMO_ENV_Forest_BG done

Pipely interprets the intent and handles the pipeline plumbing: paths, naming, folders, tasks, and version updates.
Less typing, less thinking, more creating.

Smarter asset + task flow

Natural language now covers:

Creating assets and tasks

Editing and completing tasks

Opening workfiles directly in Blender or Krita

Navigating projects without touching the filesystem

Artists stay focused; Pipely handles the structure.

Packaged admin templates (Animation Bible included)

Every install now ships with the full admin template set.
Studios and solo artists get:

Consistent show structure

Reference documents ready on day one

Zero manual copying or setup

Every new project starts clean and aligned.

A hardened release pipeline

CI now builds and tests directly from the local source tree.
What gets released is exactly what you developed.

Production teams get fewer surprises, more trust, and a repeatable installation experience.

Docs written for humans

The README now includes ready-to-use natural-language commands.
New artists can start immediately—no manual, no training session, no flags to memorize.

Why It Matters
Less command anxiety

Plain-language commands remove the fear of syntax.
Artists stay in a creative mindset instead of a technical one.

Consistent structure, zero guesswork

Assets, tasks, shots, and folders land where they should, with the right naming.
This reduces misfiled work, confusion, and rework.

Faster onboarding

New team members follow a simple ritual:

Open project.

Pick application.

Start creating.

They don't need to be technical to be productive.

Production-ready confidence

Templates ship with the package, tests validate every release, and the workflow stays predictable across machines.
This keeps leads happy and teams aligned.
