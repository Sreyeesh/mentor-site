description: Pipely v0.1.8 is a friendly, CLI-driven pipeline companion for animators,
  game devs, and small studios who want big-studio structure without big-studio overhead.
  It gives you SQLite-backed tracking for shows, assets, shots, tasks, and versions,
  plus clear status flows so everyone knows what’s Ready, WIP, Blocked, or Done. With
  one-command DCC launchers for tools like Blender, Krita, Photoshop, and After Effects,
  artists jump straight into the right scene with project-aware defaults instead of
  hunting through folders. Cross-platform support (WSL, Windows, macOS, Linux), built-in
  “doctor” checks, structured logging, and disciplined Monday-only releases keep your
  pipeline stable, transparent, and easy to trust—so your team can spend more time
  creating and less time fighting tools.
excerpt: Pipely v0.1.8 is a friendly pipeline companion for animators, game devs,
  and indie teams—bringing artist-first CLI tools, one-command DCC launchers, and
  built-in production tracking so you can ship shots and builds faster without wrestling
  folders, scripts, or DevOps. If you want big-studio clarity with small-team simplicity,
  Pipely keeps the tech out of your way and your creative work moving.

  pipeline
---

If you’ve ever lost an afternoon to “Where did that file go?” or “Which version are we actually using?”, you’re not alone. Most small animation and game teams end up duct-taping folders, scripts, and naming conventions together and calling it a pipeline.

Pipely v0.1.8 exists so you don’t have to do that anymore.

### Turning your pipeline into a friendly companion

Pipely is a CLI-based pipeline companion built specifically for animators, technical artists, and small studios. It doesn’t assume you’re a DevOps engineer. It assumes you’re busy, under deadline, and just want things to *work*.

Instead of wrestling with ad-hoc tools and half-finished scripts, you get a guided, artist-first workflow:

* A CLI and interactive mode that *speaks your language*—shows, shots, assets, not just paths and flags
* Autocomplete that knows your projects and DCCs
* Simple Git helpers so commits and status checks are quick, not painful

You stay in flow; Pipely quietly handles the “pipeline” part in the background.

### Real production tracking, without building a database yourself

Most small teams either track everything in spreadsheets… or not at all.

Pipely v0.1.8 ships with production structure baked in:

* SQLite-backed database for **shows, assets, shots, tasks, versions, and tags**
* Built-in status flows like **Ready, WIP, Blocked, Done**
* Clear visibility into “what’s on my plate” and “what’s stuck”

Instead of rebuilding the same tracking system for every project, you get a simple, opinionated foundation that just works. You still keep your creative freedom—but with a backbone that’s actually production-ready.

### One command to open the right file in the right app

How many times a day do you:

* Open Blender
* Search for the correct `.blend` file
* Hope it’s the latest version
* Realize someone else has another copy somewhere?

Pipely replaces that dance with one command:

* Launch **Blender, Krita, Photoshop, After Effects, PureRef**, and more directly from Pipely
* Use project-aware defaults so it knows *which* file to open
* Get friendly feedback when something’s off, instead of cryptic errors

The result: less hunting, fewer mistakes, faster jumps from “I need to work on this shot” to actually working on it.

### Built-in observability so tech issues don’t derail the team

Even simple pipelines get messy as soon as a few people are using them. When something breaks, you need to know *where* and *why*.

Pipely v0.1.8 bakes in observability from day one:

* Structured logging for consistent, readable logs
* Request IDs so you can trace what actually happened
* Optional StatsD metrics so tech leads can monitor behavior over time

You don’t have to bolt on debugging tools later. Pipely ships with them already wired in, so issues are faster to track down and fix.

### Discipline that makes updates safe, not scary

Updating pipeline tools mid-production can feel risky. One bad release and suddenly artists are blocked.

Pipely leans hard into release discipline:

* **Conventional commits** to keep history clean and understandable
* An automatically generated **changelog** so you know exactly what changed
* A **Monday-only release guard**, so teams get predictable updates at the start of the week—not surprises in the middle of a crunch

You stay in control. You decide when to adopt new versions. And when you do, you know what you’re getting.

---

### Designed for real-world teams and real-world machines

Creative teams rarely run on identical hardware or OS setups. Pipely is built to handle that reality:

* Works on **WSL, Windows, macOS, and Linux**
* Smart path detection keeps projects aligned across different environments
* Git/LFS-ready templates for animation, games, and illustration projects

Whether you’re a solo artist on a laptop or a small team spread over multiple machines, Pipely gives you a consistent way of working.

### Keep the tech weight off your shoulders

At its core, Pipely is about one thing: freeing creatives to focus on the work that actually ships.

* Artists stay in flow instead of playing “pipeline engineer”
* Leads get clarity on progress and blockers
* Small studios get big-studio structure without paying for a full-time pipeline department

You don’t need to become a DevOps expert. You just need a tool that respects your time and your craft.
