    <h1>I help artists, developers, and studios work smarter, create faster, and deliver at industry standards.</h1>
    <p class="lead">Disney, Blizzard Entertainment, DNEG, and indie teams around the globe have trusted me to bridge the gap between creative vision and technical execution because I’ve lived in both the animation/VFX pipeline and the engineering/DevOps space.</p>

            <h2>Hands-on mentoring built for production reality.</h2>
            <p>My mentoring and coaching practice is fully immersive and results-focused. Whether I’m guiding a junior artist through their first production-ready project, helping a developer adapt to a creative pipeline, or advising an indie team on how to take their idea from concept to delivery, I stay in the trenches with you until the work meets the bar.</p>
            <p>Because I’ve been responsible for both the artistic craft and the technical infrastructure, I know how to translate between creative language and engineering constraints—so you can stay focused on making something incredible.</p>
