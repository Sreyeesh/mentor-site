    <h1>I tutor artists and developers so they can hit studio standards with confidence.</h1>
    <p class="lead">After leading teams at Disney, Blizzard Entertainment, DNEG, and indie productions, I now dedicate my time to 1:1 tutoring. You get the same production rigor—without needing to hire an entire consulting crew.</p>

            <h2>Hands-on tutoring built for production reality.</h2>
            <p>My tutoring practice is immersive and focused on measurable wins. Whether I’m helping a student structure their first reel or coaching a professional through a complex Unreal build, we move step-by-step until the work is ready for review.</p>
            <p>Because I’ve been responsible for both artistic craft and technical infrastructure, I can translate between creative language and engineering constraints—so you stay focused on making something incredible.</p>

            <p>Through Toucan Studios OÜ I provide dedicated 1:1 tutoring for animation, game development, and creative tech students. Partnerships like Game City Kajaani keep me close to classrooms, but every engagement is still centered on individual progress.</p>
            <ul class="bio-list">
                <li>🎮 Tutor Unreal Engine developers from first prototype through release.</li>
                <li>🎨 Guide animation students through industry workflows and portfolio preparation.</li>
                <li>⚙️ Coach creatives on asset pipelines, project organization, and collaborative production.</li>

            <h3>Mission</h3>

            <h2>Industry background that informs every lesson</h2>
            <p>Before focusing solely on tutoring, I led SG Production OÜ—delivering full-stack development and pipeline automation for animation, VFX, and game studios. That work keeps my tutoring grounded in today’s production realities even though I no longer take on consulting retainers.</p>
            <p>Highlights from that era:</p>
            <ul class="bio-list">
                <li>Building custom backends and web applications tailored to studio needs.</li>
                <li>Developing frontend dashboards for producers, artists, and clients.</li>
                <li>Automating asset management and creative workflows across animation, VFX, and games.</li>
                <li>Designing production management tools that support distributed teams.</li>
                <li>Mentoring cross-functional teams in software best practices and workflow optimization.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>This cross-disciplinary background is why tutoring sessions cover both craft and process. I’ve sat in the director’s chair and the lead engineer seat—now I use that experience to elevate your personal projects.</p>
