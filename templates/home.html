            <h3>I mentor creative students and junior teams through the full pipeline.</h3>
            <p>I’m the mentor behind Toucan.ee and I still draw, animate, and build tools daily. I’ve coached university cohorts, indie studios, and solo artists through art direction, Unreal workflows, and production planning.</p>
            <p>Sessions stay humble and practical—no hype, no ego. You get the same production rigor I use on paid studio work, but in a single, student-safe call that respects your pace and budget.</p>

                <h3>What if I’m a complete beginner?</h3>
                <p>That’s who most sessions are for. We keep the hour focused on one improvement, explain every tool we touch, and capture notes so you can practice safely afterward.</p>
            </article>
            <article class="faq-item">
                <h3>What do I need before the call?</h3>
                <p>Just your current file or build, a short description of what’s stuck, and the software you already use (Blender, Krita, Unreal, Godot, etc.). I review everything before we meet.</p>
            </article>
            <article class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I only book one session?</h3>
                <p>Yes. There’s no long-term contract. Most students book when they need a confidence check or have a big critique coming up, and that single call is enough.</p>
            </article>
            <article class="faq-item">
                <h3>What happens if I need to reschedule?</h3>
                <p>You can move or cancel the slot up to 12 hours before the call. If something urgent happens, email me and we’ll find a new time or I’ll refund you.</p>
